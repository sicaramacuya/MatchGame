# MatchGame

Sample iOS color matching game. This game mocks up one of those "brain training" games based on the [Stroop Effect](https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/words.html). 

The game is built using SwiftUI and the idea of the game is there will show the user words of colors side by side and the usser need to identify if the text in the upper word matches the color of the word at the bottom. 

There will be a score the user can see to keep track of the points, also a streak and there will be a time limit of 60s.
